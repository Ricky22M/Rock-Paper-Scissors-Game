# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

## Project
As a mini project, I had decided to create a rock, paper, scissors game using only javascript to create the fundmental pieces of code to build the game off of.

## How It Works
As you enter the HTML file, you will be presented by a window prompt asking if you would like to play the game. If you accept the game functions continue, but if you decline the game session will end.

If you choose to contine you will be sent another window prompt asking to choose one of three options. These options are the letter "R" for rock, the letter "P" for paper, and the letter "S" for scissors. As type in and your letter of choice, you will confirm that's the option you will go with by clicking on the blue "OK" button. You will be sent another window prompt showing what your opponent chose and wether you won, lost, or had a draw. As you continue on with the prompt, you will be sent another window prompt showing th scorboard between yourself and the opponent you're up against. As you continue onto the next window prompt, you will be sent a message asking wether you would want to contine with the game session or not. IF you choose to continue you will restart the whole window prompt game process, except the scoreboard will continue to keep track of the scoreboard between you and your opponent. If you chose to end the game session, then you will be sent a window prompt thanking you for playing the game and will be placed on a blank white HTML document also thanking the user for participating in the game.

Of course, you can always refresh the HTML document to restart the game process as well as to replay the game again if you ended the game session too early for your enjoyment.
